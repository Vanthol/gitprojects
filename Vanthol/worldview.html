      <li>  I believe that the world was created by God. I am a Christian. I believe that God spoke and he created everything that we see on earth. It was not a random accident. It was all planned. I believe that God created animals, earth, sky, stars and humans. It is impossible for the universe to be an accident because we have discovered that if the Earth was positioned a bit off, we would either freeze or burn. We are placed in the right condition and place, this means everything created was planned.</li>
<br>
      <li>  I believe that to be a human that is a Christian, we have to fulfill God's mission. God's mission is for us to take care of the earth, his creations, his animals and his people. Therefore, it is our duty to take care of the universe. Also, he wants us to spread his name to all areas. This means we have to an advocate for God and try to preach to people about God. Finally, God has also created earth for humans to enjoy his creation. Therefore, if we have our own personal dream or amibiton, we should use our time to achieve it.</li>
